# Square One

### What is it?

Square One is a very simple game engine for 2D games.
Once macOS Sierra was released, none of my older game
engines worked anymore, so I had to create a new one.
The only working version of LWJGL for me was 3.1 so
I ran into the problem of not having the Slick Util libraries
at my disposal. I was forced to think outside the box,
especially in the text rendering department. Overall, it
was a good learning experience, and I can make games now.

### What do I need?

* LWJGL 3.1
* Java 1.8.0_60

### Features

* Easy to get up and running
* Basic quad/texture rendering
* Font loading (.fnt/.bmp)
* Text rendering
* Networking
* WAV loading/playback
* Spritesheets

### To Do

* Add more tests
* OGG support
* TCP support

### Other notes

I will be updating this if I notice any bugs in the process
of creating my own games. If you end up using this instead
of a high quality engine, please submit any issues you find.

I may also update this with new features I find might be
helpful to other people.
