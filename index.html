				<p>Square One is a very simple game engine for 2D games. Once macOS Sierra was released,
					none of my older game engines worked anymore, so I had to create a new one. The only
					working version of LWJGL for me was 3.1 so I ran into the problem of not having the
					Slick Util libraries at my disposal. I was forced to think outside the box, especially
					in the text rendering department. Overall, it was a good learning experience, and I can
					make games now.</p>

				<p>I will be updating this if I notice any bugs in the process of creating my own games.
					If you end up using this instead of a high quality engine, please submit any issues you
					find. I may also update this with new features I find might be helpful to other people.</p>
